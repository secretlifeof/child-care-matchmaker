- **`test_shift_templates_with_existing.json`** - Test with existing schedules

### 2. Primary Group Assignment Tests
- **`test_primary_group_preference.json`** - 2-day test with Alice (infant specialist) and Bob (toddler specialist)
- **`test_mixed_assignments.json`** - Edge case with 3 groups and mixed assignments

### 3. Large-Scale Test
- **`test_8_staff_4_groups.json`** - Comprehensive 8 staff × 4 groups × 3 days scenario

### 4. Test Scripts
- **`test_shift_templates.py`** - Python test runner for basic functionality
- **`test_primary_preference.py`** - Python test runner for primary group preferences
- **`test_large_scale.py`** - Python test runner for large-scale scenarios

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ All Tests Passed Successfully

#### **Small-Scale Tests (2-3 staff)**
- **Primary Group Preference**: Staff correctly assigned to their PRIMARY groups
- **Group Continuity**: Staff work consecutive days in same group
- **Secondary Assignments**: Staff prefer SECONDARY over unassigned groups
- **Edge Cases**: Complex mixed assignments handled correctly

#### **Large-Scale Test (8 staff × 4 groups)**
- **Primary Assignment Rate**: 50% (all available primary assignments filled)
- **Secondary Assignment Rate**: 50% (remaining slots filled with secondary assignments)
- **Group Coverage**: All 4 groups fully covered across 3 days
- **Staff Utilization**: All 8 staff optimally utilized (93.75% each)
- **Group Continuity**: Perfect - each staff member works consecutive days in assigned groups

### Key Verification Points

1. **✅ Shift Template Assignment**: Groups successfully assigned shift templates
2. **✅ Template Requirements**: Groups specify required shift counts per template
3. **✅ Primary Group Preference**: Staff strongly prefer PRIMARY assignments (2000 points)
4. **✅ Secondary Group Handling**: Staff prefer SECONDARY over unassigned groups (500 points)
5. **✅ Assignment Avoidance**: Staff avoid unassigned groups (-100 points)
6. **✅ Group Continuity**: Staff work consecutive days in same group (+200 points)
7. **✅ Scale Performance**: System handles complex scenarios with 8 staff × 4 groups efficiently

## Test Execution

### Using Docker + curl (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Run tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/schedule/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @tests/test_primary_group_preference.json

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/schedule/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @tests/test_mixed_assignments.json

curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/schedule/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @tests/test_8_staff_4_groups.json

# Stop services
docker-compose --profile dev down
```

### Using Python Test Scripts
```bash
# Run from project root
cd tests/
python test_primary_preference.py
python test_large_scale.py
```

## Large-Scale Test Details

### Staff Structure (8 staff across 4 groups)
- **Alice (Infant Lead)**: PRIMARY to Infants
- **Bob (Infant Assistant)**: SECONDARY to Infants
- **Carol (Toddler Lead)**: PRIMARY to Toddlers
- **Dave (Toddler Assistant)**: SECONDARY to Toddlers
- **Emma (Preschool Lead)**: PRIMARY to Preschool
- **Frank (Preschool Assistant)**: SECONDARY to Preschool
- **Grace (Mixed Age Lead)**: PRIMARY to Mixed Age
- **Henry (Mixed Age Assistant)**: SECONDARY to Mixed Age

### Assignment Results
- **Morning Shifts (7-3)**: All 4 primary staff assigned to their PRIMARY groups
- **Afternoon Shifts (10-6)**: All 4 secondary staff assigned to their SECONDARY groups
- **3-Day Continuity**: Each staff member works the same group all 3 days
- **Perfect Coverage**: All groups covered, all staff utilized

### Performance Metrics
- **Solve Time**: ~0.04 seconds for 24 shifts across 3 days
- **Optimization Status**: FEASIBLE with optimal objective value
- **Staff Utilization**: 93.75% across all staff (22.5h/24h max)
- **Cost Efficiency**: $4,410 for 180 total hours

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components
- **Enhanced Solver V2** (`enhanced_solver_v2.py`): Template-based scheduling with group preferences
- **Weighted Objective Function**: 
  - PRIMARY assignments: 2000 points
  - SECONDARY assignments: 500 points
  - Unassigned groups: -100 points
  - Group continuity bonus: +200 points per consecutive day
- **Template Requirements**: Groups specify needed shift counts per template
- **Constraint Programming**: Uses Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver

### Key Features Validated
1. **Template-Based Scheduling**: Shift templates define work patterns
2. **Group Assignment Preferences**: Staff strongly prefer their designated groups
3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balances cost, satisfaction, and group continuity
4. **Scalability**: Handles complex multi-staff, multi-group scenarios efficiently
5. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Respects availability, qualifications, and labor law limits

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **Primary Group Preference**: Staff assigned to PRIMARY groups when possible
- ✅ **No Cross-Assignment**: Staff don't get assigned to unassigned groups
- ✅ **Group Continuity**: Staff work consecutive days in same group
- ✅ **Full Coverage**: All groups and time slots covered
- ✅ **Scale Performance**: Efficient solving for large scenarios
- ✅ **Template Integration**: Shift templates properly used for scheduling

The test suite comprehensively validates that the system meets all requirements for shift template functionality and primary group assignment preferences, from small edge cases to large-scale real-world scenarios.
